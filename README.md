circolont project

Project under development related to the visual representation in processing.js of the audio generated with the max masp patch by 24 audio oscillators.

The frequency of the sinusoidals is represented as the frequency of generation of the related circle (one for each audio oscillator) in the processing.js code.

The repository also contain a 12 circle version and an initial D3.js patch version.
